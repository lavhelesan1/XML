# XML
Hey ya'all, I'm new to this, so I'm not even sure if I'm doing this right.
This program for a console application that processes an xml document which contains the whole hamlet paly.
The console application asks the user for a name from the play, then it checks if the name if the name is a valid name
the application displays information about the character.
After all this is done, the information about the character is saved in an xml document named <speaker name.xml>
